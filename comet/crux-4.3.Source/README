For a gentle introduction to Crux, please see the Crux home page at
doc/user/crux.html or at http://crux.ms/.  Note that the HTML pages
for individual Crux commands are generated automatically, so these
will not exist in your local directory until after building the
software.

For installation instructions, see the installation tutorial linked
from the Crux home page listed above.

Source code can be found in the src subdirectory.

Documentation for Crux developers is at doc/developer/crux-developer.html.

Various smoke and regression tests are under the test directory.  The
primary set of tests use Cucumber, and are under test/smoke-test.  To
run them, install cucumber and then do "cd test/smoke-test; cucumber".
