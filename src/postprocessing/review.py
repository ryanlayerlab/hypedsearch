def __edit_distance_long_swaps(a: str, b: str, dist: int = 0) -> int:
    '''
    Find the edit distance between two strings allowing for swaps up to a distance dist. 
    
    Example:
        a: 'ABCDE', b: 'ADCBE'
        
        edit distance with swap dist of 0: 2 (substitution of B for D and D for B)
        edit distance with swap dist of 1: 1 (swap of B and D)
        
    Limitations: if a position has 2 swaps, it will not be picked up. Example:
        a: 'CBEDA', b: 'ABCDE'
        
        A has been swapped with C then with E, but the final output will be edit distance of 3
        for all of the swaps
        
    Inputs:
        a:   (str) the first string
        b:   (str) the second string
        dist:(int) the swapping distance allowed. Default=0
